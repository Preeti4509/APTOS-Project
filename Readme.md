## Vision

The **Anonymous Messaging** smart contract enables users to send and store messages on the blockchain without revealing their identity. This provides a secure, decentralized, and censorship-resistant platform for anonymous communication. By using blockchain technology, the system ensures message immutability and transparency, while preserving the privacy of the sender.

## Features

- **Anonymous Message Storage**:
  - Messages are stored on-chain without recording the identity of the sender, ensuring true anonymity.
- **Message Retrieval**:
  - Users can retrieve stored messages using their account, allowing for decentralized message access.

## Future Scope

1. **Encrypted Messaging**:
   - Add message encryption for enhanced privacy, ensuring only the intended recipient can read the content.
2. **Multi-User Messaging**:

   - Extend functionality to allow multiple users to share and view messages across different accounts.

3. **Message Expiry**:

   - Implement message expiration, where messages are automatically deleted after a certain period.

4. **Message Moderation**:
   - Introduce optional message filtering or moderation to prevent abuse while preserving anonymity.

This contract serves as a foundation for anonymous communication systems, offering a decentralized and secure platform for sharing information while protecting user identities.
